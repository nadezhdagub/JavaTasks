/*
Write a collector that partitions all words in a stream into two groups: palindromes (true) and usual words (false). 
The collector should return Map<Boolean, List<String>>. All input words will be in the same case (lower).

Let's remind, a palindrome is a word or phrase which reads the same backward or forward, such as noon or level. 
In our case, a palindrome is always a word. For details, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome

Hint: the method reverse() of StringBuilder may help you.

Important. You should write only the collector in any valid formats but without ; on the end.
It will be passed as an ï»¿argument to the collect() method of a stream as shown below.

String[] words = ...
Map<Boolean, List<String>> palindromeOrNoMap = 
        Arrays.stream(words)
              .collect(...your_collector_will_be_passed_here...);


Examples of the valid solution formats: Collectors.reducing(...) or reducing(...)
*/
Collectors.partitioningBy(a -> a.equals(new StringBuilder(a).reverse().toString()))
